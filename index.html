        "description": "The Museum of the Village of Rockville Centre is located in the former home of resident Samuel Freeman Phillips. Phillips, a retired sea captain and active member of the Rockville Centre community during the village’s early growth years, built this house for himself and his wife Marinda in 1882, located at 191 Village Avenue. By the 1970s the house was in disrepair and about to be torn down to make way for a parking lot for what was is now the medical building at 165 N. Village Avenue. Concerned residents and the Village Board of Trustees arranged to preserve the home. In 1975 the house was moved from North Village Avenue to its current location on Hempstead Avenue. It reopened in 1978 as the Museum of the Village of Rockville Centre, and is styled in décor reflective of the Victorian era. Filled with artifacts from the 19th and 20th centuries, the Museum’s displays aim to provide a glimpse into what life was like in this area many years ago."

In 1957, the Parish purchased the Clinton Avenue School from the RVCSD and renamed it St. Agnes Cathedral Elementary School. The north and south wings were added in the 1960s."

The Church had mission status until 1911 when it became its own incorporated parish, giving it parochial status. It continues to serve Episcopalians from RVC and neighboring communities."

The Tudor once housed the popular Rockville Grill.  During World War II, the Rockville Centre Civil Defense Unit was housed in the basement.  Because it was the tallest building in RVC at the time, it provided the perfect perch to search for enemy planes."

In 1905 the Reverend Peter Quealy began to acquire property around what was the old Marble Church, on the site where St. Agnes stands today.  Rev. Quealy oversaw the building of an ornate Parochial School in the English Gothic Style where the current rectory now stands.  This school opened in 1917.  In 1933, the old church was demolished to make room for the current church which was completed in 1935.  In 1957 it was designated a Cathedral when the Diocese of Rockville Centre was formed. The anvil from the old blacksmith’s shop is still placed in front of the church.  Marble columns left over from the old Marble Church can be found on the St. Agnes campus."

The school got its name because it was the only high school on the South Shore of Long Island, east of Jamaica. The second floor of the high school also housed the Rockville Centre Public Library until it moved to its own building on Clinton Avenue in 1912. The initial enrollment was 316 pupils which included 35 non-residents. The population outgrew its building, so the District built a new high school on Hillside Avenue in 1924. Three decades later, the burgeoning high school population prompted the construction of the current high school on Shepherd Street, which opened in 1955. The building on Hillside Avenue became South Side Junior High (now called South Side Middle School). Village Hall continues to occupy the space of the original SSHS; the bell tower was removed during renovations and the red brick is now painted white."

The second depot was built in 1908 at Front Street and Park Avenue. That small, charming building was razed in 1949 and gave way to the current building that boasted elevated tracks and an escalator. Milestones in RVC’s train history include: an 1898 whistle stop by Theodore Roosevelt as he campaigned for Governor of NY State; RVC’s first electric train, which arrived in 1926; and the first LIRR station to have an escalator (1951). Unfortunately, on February 17, 1950, at a grade crossing on Banks Avenue, two trains collided head on killing 32 people and injuring 100 others. At that time, it was the deadliest train accident in LIRR history. "

In 1912 the Rockville Centre School District appropriated funds for a new library to supplement the $10,000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation. The library was built to house 16,000 books and space for 35 to 40 patrons. This Carnegie Library Building on Clinton Avenue is one of only three built on Long Island.  When the library moved into its new building on North Village Avenue in 1962, the old Carnegie library became commercial office space."
