In the early 1970s, the house was nearly torn down, but instead the Village Board of Trustees arranged to have it donated it was moved and turned into a museum.  The house was purchased for $1 and in 1975, it was relocated by truck from North Village Avenue to its current location at 28 Hempstead Avenue and officially opened as a fully decorated museum in 1978."

In 1895 the Rockville Centre school district voted to build a new school on Clinton Avenue. An addition was added in 1906.By the 1950’s the demand for Catholic elementary education in Rockville Centre was at an all-time high and the 10 room school on College Place could not accommodate the interested students. In 1957, after the establishment of the Rockville Centre Diocese and the designation of St. Agnes church as a cathedral, the parish purchased the Clinton Avenue School from the School District and renamed it St. Agnes Cathedral Elementary School. The north and south wings were added in the 1960’s."

The first service there was held on Easter Sunday, April 21, 1889. The original rectory was built in 1892. During the Great Depression, the buildings were expanded, and DeLong & DeLong, the Philadelphia wood carvers who did the wood carvings in the chapel at Valley Forge, were commissioned to create the woodwork adorning the choir and sanctuary."

The Tudor one housed the Rockville Grill, owned by Karl Wegener, who also owned the Arbor Inn on Woods Avenue. During World War II, the Rockville Centre Civil Defense Unit was housed in the basement. Because it was the tallest building in RVC at the time, it also provided the perfect perch to search for any enemy planes."

As time went on, the congregation moved to the First Public School House, and in 1905 the Reverend Peter Quealy began to acquire property around what was the old Marble Church, on the site where St. Agnes stands today. Rev. Quealy oversaw the building of an ornate Parochial School in the English Gothic Style where the current rectory now is.  The school opened in 1917.  In 1933, the old church was demolished to make room for the current church which was completed in 1935 and in 1957 was designated a Cathedral when the Diocese of Rockville Centre was formed. You will be able to spot the anvil from the old blacksmith’s shop in front of the church and a few of the marble columns left over from the old Marble Church surrounds the St. Agnes campus."

The school outgrew its building and in relocated to Hillside Avenue (currently South Side Middle School) in 1923 (or 1924?)

In 1898 Theodore Roosevelt made a whistle stop in Rockville Centre during his campaign for Governor of New York State.  In 1926 the first electric train pulled into the station where a large crowd had gathered to witness the new arrival, including school children waving American flags. Free round trip tickets were given to those who wished to take the train to its last stop in Babylon and return to Rockville Centre. In 1950, just when the railroad tracks were beginning to be elevated and a single track was being used for both east and west bound trains, the switchman fell asleep and this resulted in the most horrendous head on train collision in history at that time. Once the tracks were fully elevated, a ceremony took place with Thomas A. Dewey, the then Governor of New York State in attendance."

In 1901, the school district applied for and received a $10,000 grant from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation to build a library building.  In 1912 the Rockville Centre School District appropriated funds for a new library, to supplement the $10,000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation. The library was built to house 16,000 books and space for 35 to 40 patrons. The first Children’s Librarian was Winona Caroline Martin, who took a leave of absence to join the Expeditionary Forces in France during the First World War. Unfortunately, she contracted Scarlet Fever aboard the ship carrying her there. She died in a hospital in France which was then bombed by the German Air Force.  A Library Auxiliary was formed that would later become known as the Friends of the Rockville Centre Library now located on North village Avenue. This Carnegie Library Building on Clinton Avenue is one of only three still standing on Long Island."
