Quealy oversaw the building of an ornate Parochial School in the English Gothic Style where the current rectory now stands.  This school opened in 1917.  In 1933, the old church was demolished to make room for the current church which was completed in 1935.  In 1957 it was designated a Cathedral when the Diocese of Rockville Centre was formed. The anvil from the old blacksmith\’s shop is still placed in front of the church.  Marble columns left over from the old Marble Church can be found on the St. Agnes campus."
